            <!-- PROBLEM -->
            <div class="exp-category">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the 2020 pandemic, enrollment in the Technological University of Panama (UTP) electrical
                    engineering faculty has declined
                    at an alarming rate.
                    Internal studies revealed that many new students struggle with mathematical reasoning and
                    programming, mainly due to poor
                    school preparation and limited exposure to technical tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, female representation in these careers remains significantly lower than male
                    participation.
                    To address these barriers, the university created <em>CTechnology Camp for Young People in
                        STEM</em>, a program designed
                    to strengthen math and programming skills for female high-school students and inspire them to
                    consider careers in electrical engineering.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- MOTIVATION -->
            <div class="exp-category">
                <h3>Why I Joined</h3>
                <p>
                    I volunteered for this project to support the programming division.
                    With my experience in real-world electronic and software projects, I wanted to help students develop
                    confidence and
                    discover the creativity and opportunities within STEM fields.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- APPROACH -->
            <div class="exp-category">
                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    I designed and led the programming and hardware workshops. To ensure accessibility and hands-on
                    learning, I chose
                    an open-source and practical toolset:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Python</strong> for its simplicity and versatility</li>
                    <li><strong>ESP32 microcontrollers</strong> for hardware, wireless communication, and digital
                        electronics</li>
                    <li><strong>MicroPython + VS Code</strong> for a unified programming and testing workflow</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Students built small interactive systems, connected sensors, and wrote their first Python scripts.
                    The focus was on learning through experimentation and making abstract concepts tangible.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- OUTCOME -->
            <div class="exp-category">
                <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    The results were remarkable. Out of the original <strong>15 participants</strong>,
                    <strong>12 were admitted into the electrical engineering faculty</strong> and selected engineering
                    as their chosen field of study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The success of the camp attracted interest from private equity groups, who later expanded and
                    replicated the program across
                    the country—reaching a much wider audience and continuing to promote STEM careers among young women.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- LEARNINGS -->
            <div class="exp-category">
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Teaching complete beginners reinforced the importance of clear explanation, patience, and real-world
                    examples.
                    I saw firsthand how access to proper tools and mentorship can reshape a student’s perception of
                    engineering.
