            <h2 data-lang="about-title">About Me</h2>
            <p data-lang="about-intro">
                Hello! I'm <strong>Your Name</strong>, a passionate and dedicated Electrical and Electronics Engineer.
                I've been working in the field since May 2022, focusing on both electrical and electronic systems
                design, with an emphasis on innovation and real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p data-lang="about-body">
                Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to design and install complex electrical systems,
                including lightning rods, grounding systems, and reactive capacitors compensation systems. I've worked
                on organizing and setting benchmarks for nationwide electricity controls in universities, utilizing
                SCADA systems and Power BI to enhance decision-making processes.
            </p>
            <p data-lang="about-body">
                I have conducted and organized power quality analysis tests across both public and private sectors
                nationwide. Additionally, I have experience designing and overseeing high-voltage systems (13.8kV and
                derivatives) ensuring safety and efficiency in electrical distribution.
            </p>
            <p data-lang="about-body">
                On the electronic side, I have worked on several innovative projects, including electromechanical
                teleoperation, spectral analysis for watermelons, and the development of the first Panamanian patent for
                nanoelectrical circuits. I've also designed a scoring board for the university's baseball field and
                contributed to multiple international publications and conferences, including IEEE and Neurocomputing
                (Elsevier).
            </p>
            <p data-lang="about-body">
                I am honored to have been invited as a judge for international competitions in Europe and America.
                Furthermore, I have been involved in designing and building low-cost robotic kits for public schools to
                help students develop robotics skills. I have also contributed to specialized electronics projects aimed
                at assisting disabled people, such as developing a smart wheelchair for paraplegic individuals.
            </p>
            <p data-lang="about-conclusion">
                I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in innovative ways. If you'd
                like to know more about my work or collaborate, feel free to explore my projects or get in touch!
